                <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                <p>ArcTracker Bot ("we", "our", or "the Bot") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Discord bot.</p>

                <h3>2. Data Collection</h3>
                <p>ArcTracker Bot is designed with privacy in mind. <strong>We do not collect, store, or share any personal data from our users.</strong></p>
                <p>Specifically:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We do not store user IDs, usernames, or messages.</li>
                    <li>We do not track user behavior or usage history.</li>
                    <li>We do not use cookies or tracking technologies.</li>

            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>3. Data Usage</h3>
                <p>The Bot only processes the data provided in the slash commands (e.g., search queries) momentarily to generate a response. This data is processed in real-time and is not saved to any database or log file accessible by us.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>4. Third-Party Services</h3>
